+   the links within #centeringDiv should probably be buttons because we're not doing the gallery.php thing anymore. i'll just link to the pictures if people don't have javascript enabled.
+   the links within #galleryDiv should be figure elements.
+   all of the worktypes need to be renamed... seeing as none of them are the same as the categories I started out with.
